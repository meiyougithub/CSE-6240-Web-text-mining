This blog is based on $\\textit{NIPS 2016 Tutorial: Generative Adversarial Networks (Ian Goodfellow)}$ in general. The blog will introduce the background, application and principle of why it works. Furthermore, the blog will use MNIST to implement a simple GAN and also a trial of GAN application combined with autoencoder."

    "GAN is the relection of adversarial thinking in neural network. It includes two neural networks. One is the Generator network, which aims at making fake data look real; the other is the Discriminator network, which aims at telling the difference with fake data from the real data. The latter outputs a number between 0 and 1, which stands for the probability that input is from real data. For instance, the ouput 1 stands for real data, and 0 stands for fake data. In theory, with the convergence of training, each piece of data generated by the Generator network should be \"hard\" enough for the Discriminator network to decide whether real or not. Hence, the output of the latter should be 0.5."
